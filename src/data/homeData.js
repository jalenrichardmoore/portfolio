    <p>
        Hello, I'm Jalen Moore - a Junior Gameplay Programmer and AI Engineer with a strong passion for designing games that create
        unique player experiences through both gameplay and narrative. I recently graduated from Loyola University New Orleans with a
        degree in Computer Science - Game Programming. I have hands-on experience with C++, C#, Python, and the Unity game engine. 
        <br /><br />
        My primary focus is the integration of machine learning into game development to build adaptive gameplay systems. Additionally,
        I'm passionate about narrative design in games, and enjoy exploring the intersection of storytelling and interactivity. I am interested
        in learning more about writing in video games.
        <br /><br />
        Iâ€™m currently seeking entry-level opportunities to grow as a programmer and contribute to meaningful, innovative projects. 
        This portfolio showcases a collection of academic and personal work across game development and software development.
